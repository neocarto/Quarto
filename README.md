# Quarto Examples

**Quarto** is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc. It allows to create dynamic content with Python, R, Julia, and Observable. In this repository, I show how it is now possible to combine an analysis written in **R** and a visualization written in **Observable** javascript.
